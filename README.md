This is repository for my introduction to Web Design and Development Homework.
This week, we learned about file types, directories, and version control systems. File types are specific file formats that contain different types of content (text, video, audio, etc.) Directories are digital cataloging systems that organize work and file types of pages. Version control systems are systems on platforms like GitHub that save all previous versions of your project, allow coders to collaborate with others on projects, and store previous versions of projects for backup purposes.
