1. The difference between universal, element, class, and id selectors is just method of categorizing css styling. If you want everything on the page to be styled or positioned a certain way, then use the universal element. If you want every element in the document to change a certain way, then use the element selector. If you want select images to change, then specify the class in the css selector. If you want specific ID elements to change, then use the ID selector. It's important to note that class attributes take precedence over ID attribute, so in complex website using the class elector can be useful.
2. I chose three colors based on the images I found online. I actually used a color picker tool that eyedrops a color and says its hex code. Then I used these hex codes to set the colors of certain elements in my css. This included seal brown, mustard yellow, and a sienna background.
3. The main challenge this week was centering elements on my page. I still cannot figure out how to make my images centered. I know how to center on a regular page, but something is taking precedence and not allowing me to do so on this one. Every time I tried to allow this change, it would negatively effect something else. After much trial and error, I decided to leave it as is because it wasn't essential to my assignment. Other than that, this assignment took great patients.
