  <div class="stanza-1" id="poem">
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, </br>
    And sorry I could not travel both </br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood </br>
    And looked down one as far as I could </br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth; </br>
  </div>
  </br>
  <div class="stanza-2" id="poem">
    Then took the other, as just as fair, </br>
    And having perhaps the better claim, </br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear; </br>
    Though as for that the passing there </br>
    Had worn them really about the same, </br>
  </div>
  </br>
  <div class="stanza-3" id="poem">
    And both that morning equally lay </br>
    In leaves no step had trodden black. </br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another day! </br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way, </br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back. </br>
  </div>
  </br>
  <div class="stanza-4" id="poem">
    I shall be telling this with a sigh </br>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence: </br>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” </br>
    I took the one less traveled by, </br>
    And that has made all the difference.
