1. My 'client' for this site was a fictitious pizza parlor business. Their needs for the website were to 1) Brand themselves with an online interface 2) Have contact information and input capabilities so customers can order from them 3) Have an online menu page.
2. It is important to consider a mobile-first design because it is the most common way people access websites. Over 51% of the global population accesses the internet from ONLY their smart phone. Therefore, if you don't design your website with this in mind, you are going to lose a huge potential audience if they aren't able to easily navigate your page via mobile device.
3. My challenge this week was being able to change the font color of my menu bar when the hovering pseudo-class is activated. For some reason the text box is the same color as the font text, which makes the text disappear. I have in my code that the hover color is set to black, but something is overriding this style element. I still have yet to figure out this error. Some things that were successful this week included creating sizable images that adjust to the page size automatically. Another thing that was successful was the overall styling, aesthetic, and layout of my site. The nav bar works and is clean. The dropdown menu works great. Probably my cleanest webpage yet!
