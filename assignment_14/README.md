1. The library I chose from was Foundation.
2. The local file I used was Foundation's primary .css file. Having it be local made more sense because I can easily access the file, see exactly what it is doing, and include it with my website upload to GitHub. I used the CDN for Foundation so that the class content can be fetched fast and efficiently.  
3. HTML5 is revolutionary because there are no external plugins in its code. For example, you can have videos files in HTML5 without the user downloading flash/any other plugin to play it. Overall, it implements more features and is a universal markup language that can be opened on most browsers.
4. I faced a lot of challenges this week. Mostly I was confused by how to elegantly implement CSS frameworks. After a brief office hour appointment with the instructor, I was able to better understand its system and utilize Foundation's tools. I was able to better understand how to draw images via canvas, and use Foundation as a shortcut for creating essential website features. Eventually, I was able to use class elements to improve my table and form on my website. Although my finished product for this assignment might not look as aesthetic as my past assignments, it functions much more fluidly.
