1. There should be just one of each main document element tag in a given html page. However, there is no limit as to how many elements can be embedded within the <head> and <body> tags. The head tag is where you put attributes of the page (like meta data) and inside the body tag is where you put information and instructions for content you want displayed on your webpage.
2. Structural markup is what gives information about the structure of a document such as page breaks, paragraphs, titles, lists, sections. Semantic markup are tags that change the literature within the text of a document such as italics, bold, quotes, citations, definition, addresses, strikethroughs, etc.
3. My success this week was definitely workflow. I'm starting to figure out really effective strategies and techniques to create code quickly, efficiently, and cleanly. My challenges this week was retaining all of the new elements and their functions, and how to write them out correctly. I overcame this challenge by rereading the class website and practicing frequently when making my recipe website.
