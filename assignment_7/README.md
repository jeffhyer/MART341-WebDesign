1. A common form I see on the web are checkout forms, which ask users to submit their payment information and billing address so that orders can accurately be sent to customers. This is a very important form for businesses with online shopping platforms.
2. Examples of text inputs are password inputs, comment inputs, and username inputs. This allows users to access the html form and enter their information to be submitted. Examples of selection inputs include checkboxes and radio inputs, where information is already listed, the user just needs to choose options to be submitted. I think of radio inputs like multiple choice questions. Button inputs are just as they sound, buttons that have a function that users can activate once clicked. Examples include an upload button, submit button, and image buttons.
3. My successes this week included workflow, which was creating an effective flow to find code and insert it into my page. My challenges included customization of inputs, tables, and buttons. Very quickly can details be mistyped, and it's challenging to organize all of these functions in a readable and easy-to-navigate manner--but these skills come with more practice.
