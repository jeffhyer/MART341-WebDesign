1. Div tags are essentially divider tags, which create blocks/sections within a page. It's very useful in organizing and structuring pages. Class attributes are used as identifiers for elements within a page. It groups similar types of elements together that are labeled under the same value. This is useful for styling, because I can style a certain class and the browser will style ALL the content labeled with that designated class. Similarly, the ID attribute can be used to declared a value to an element, but only one can be used per element and are more specific to that exact element (classes are more general). Spans are similar to div tags in that they divide, but they can be used as 'sub' sections within a div tag. This is used as page get more advanced with specific styling needs.
2. Embedding videos from YouTube and Vimeo are beneficial because if it weren't embedded, the webpage would need to store all of the video's data, which is oftentimes a lot of storage that can slow the page down. These embedded videos are already compressed for web optimization.
3. My challenge this week was understanding multiple source video elements and what they are doing exactly. It took me quite some time to even get my sourced video to appear on my page correctly. I visited w3 schools several times and also reached out to my professor in order to better understand their purpose and structure.
