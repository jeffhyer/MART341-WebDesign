      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <p>
        Sundown<br />
        Ever so slow now<br />
        Remind me I'm free man<br />
        Freer than I've been<br />
        It's something I'm feeling<br />
        I'm wonderfully breathing<br />
        Blessed in the rainfall<br />
        Cleansed like the downpour<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        And I know it's fine to end our time<br />
        Be safe, be true, and I'll think of you<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Live well, you reap what you sow<br />
        The future is bright if we can ebb with the flow<br />
        You're something, I'm nothing, we were everything<br />
        Anything to save me from the goodness she gave me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Moonrise<br />
        Over my headlights<br />
        And I'm on the right track<br />
        I've taken my life back<br />
        And turned it upside down<br />
        You're living for that sweet sound<br />
        You'll laugh like the warm sun<br />
        Cuts through me like the only one<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        And I know it's fine to end our time<br />
        Be safe, be true, and I'll think of you<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Live well, you reap what you sow<br />
        The future is bright if we can ebb with the flow<br />
        You're something, I'm nothing, we were everything<br />
        Anything to save me from the goodness she gave me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It's nothing less than a mystery<br />
        How it came to this I see<br />
        And if it comes to this I know<br />
        We'll have had more than most did so<br />
        In a dream that I have had<br />
        We departed, ended what we had started<br />
        And I pray it doesn't come to that<br />
        If it does thanks for the love we had<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Live well, you reap what you sow<br />
        The future is bright if we can ebb with the flow<br />
        You're something, I'm nothing, we were everything<br />
        Anything to save me from the goodness she gave me<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Live well, you reap what you sow<br />
        The future is bright if we can ebb with the flow<br />
        You're something, I'm nothing, we were everything<br />
        Anything to save me from the goodness she gave me<br />
