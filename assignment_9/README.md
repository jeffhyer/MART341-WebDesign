1. To recap my experience learning HTML this week, I'd say what was old was the four main document elements. What was new was creating a menu for the webpage and linking them all together. What was challenging to figure out is how to style the nav elements on my page. I still can't seem to find a way to make the menu bar not look like dated links despite having changed their style elements.
2. To reiterate the last question, I'm really keen to learn how to make clean menu bars that don't look like blue underlined links. I'm also eager to learn how to make the spacing my page more modern with lot's of padding.
3. To overcome my challenges this week, I spent a lot of time researching w2schools for reminders and insight on HTML semantics/attributes. It seems like one mistake and the entire page collapses, so it's been easiest to constantly reference w2schools and copy their code exactly so there are no obvious errors for basic lines of the code.
