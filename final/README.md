# Jeff Hyer MART341-WebDesign
1. Through this course, I learned a ton about web development. Words like "GitHub" and "repositories" sounded foreign before this semester, but now, I fully understand their function and role in web development. I understand that these platforms store website material, such as my assignments, and allow internet users with the proper link to view these sites. Version control is a very helpful tool because it keeps track of every edit/modification the coder has made so that every site version can be accessed. Ultimately, through this course I learned exactly how websites are fetched by internet browsers and how they are coded.
2. The main concepts I learned from this course were the css elements. It took quite some time to grasp how each element interacts with the other (how margins and padding are different, for instance) but now I have a much better understanding of this knowledge. I learned that sites can be very customizable, and even fonts can be 'downloaded' and included in a repository folder for a site to use. I learned how to size images for responsive webpages to make the layout designs clean and easy to navigate.
3. Challenges I had this week was the javascript features in my website. The image carousel was difficult to implement, but after much research and assistance, I was finally able to include it on my site and insert its code correctly. This created additional interaction to the site that is very valuable.
